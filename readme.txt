## Why did you create this program?
This was my submission for my Game Development module at Newcastle University in which I had to create a game from scratch. I decided to create something small in scope while also pushing myself as a programmer.
Thus, I decided on a game based around Noughts and Crosses.

## What were you careful about?
I was careful not to focus too much on the art and keep the scope small. I've had many projects that get out of hand; thus I kept the game to 2 levels and two different levels of A.I. 
Initially wanted to implement a version of "Ultimate Noughts and Crosses" but I ran out of time and focused on refining the current game. 

## What did you find difficult?
Implementing the "Unbeatable" A.I. was the hardest part. Although, once I understood the theory of Minimax A.I. and Alpha and Beta pruning it didn't take me too long to implement.

## What points do you want us particularly focus on your work?
The implementation of the "Unbeatable" A.I. is the most impressive part if the code, however, I am proud of all my coding on this project.

## If you took some source codes as reference, what part of them did you use? Please also tell us the filename of that part.
I used a plugin for the dialogue system called "Dialogic". The creator of Dialogic - Emilio - to my surprise, commented on my game on Itch.io. (See link at the top). 
See here for the Dialogic Source code: https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic. All Dialogic work is in a separate folder (CSC3224-Coursework---Afternoon-with-the-Queen\dialogic)

## If you are using a library or function created by someone else, please put those parts in a separate file and write the corresponding filename.
Please refer to the answer above.
