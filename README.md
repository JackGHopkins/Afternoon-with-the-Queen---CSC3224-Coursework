# CSC3024 - An Afternoon with the Queen

This is **Jack Hopkins' CSC3024 Coursework**. The aim is to create a basic game for the coursework (aims will be further specified later). 

## Premise

In the game you take on the role of a prisoner which has been offered the chance of freedom if you please the Queen with a game of ***Noughts and Crosses***. However, what intially seems like a simple game gets made much harder as it is not specified what type of Noughts and crosses ***Her Majesty*** likes to play. 

And so, you are put up against the queen to play a bizzare version of Noughts and Cross refered to as: ***Ultimate Noughts and Crosses***. 

*Can you win?*
*Can you gain you freedom again?*

Only time will tell...
