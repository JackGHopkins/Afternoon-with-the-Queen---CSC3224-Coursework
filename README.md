# CSC3024 - An Afternoon with the Queen

This is **Jack Hopkins' CSC3024 Coursework**. The aim is to create a basic game for the coursework (aims will be further specified later). 

## Premise

In the game you take on the role of a prisoner which has been offered the chance of freedom if you please the Queen with a game of ***Noughts and Crosses***. However, what intially seems like a simple game gets made much harder as it is not specified what type of Noughts and crosses ***Her Majesty*** likes to play. 

And so, you are put up against the queen to play a bizzare version of Noughts and Cross refered to as: ***Ultimate Noughts and Crosses***. 

*Can you win?*
*Can you gain you freedom again?*

Only time will tell...

# To Do list

## Coursework 1 | March 1st 2021 |
> This first piece of coursework provides an opportunity for you to develop a prototype of your game. A prototype is not a full implementation of a game but should allow a player to:
> 1) Play a small or restricted element of a game.
> 2) Understand the genre of a game.
> 3) Realise the gameplay expectations.
> 4) Achieve some limited goals within a game.
> 5) Run the game from a web page (link must be provided).
> 6) Provide developer help (like cheats to allow greater testing).
